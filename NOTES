EC2:
Amazon EC2 is a web service that allows you to run virtual servers, known as instances, in the cloud.
These instances can be used for a variety of purposes, including running applications, hosting websites, and performing data analysis.

Types: 
1.General Purpose: Balanced CPU, memory, and networking (e.g., t3, m5).
2.Compute Optimized: High-performance processors (e.g., c5).
3.Memory Optimized: Large amounts of RAM (e.g., r5).
4.Storage Optimized: High read/write speeds (e.g., i3).
5.Accelerated Computing: GPUs for heavy compute tasks (e.g., p3).


Security Groups:
Virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to instances.

Elastic IP Addresses:
Static, public IP addresses that can be remapped between instances.

Key Pairs:
Secure login credentials (public/private key pairs) for EC2 instances.

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):
Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
Types: 
1.Application Load Balancer, 
2.Network Load Balancer, 
3.Classic Load Balancer.

Auto Scaling:
Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand.

Amazon Machine Images (AMIs):
Pre-configured templates for your instances, including operating system and application software.

Types: 
Public 
Private 
Marketplace AMIs.

Elastic Block Store (EBS):
Persistent block storage for use with EC2 instances.

Types: SSD (gp2, gp3, io1, io2) and HDD (st1, sc1).
