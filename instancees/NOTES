EC2:
Amazon EC2 is a web service that allows you to run virtual servers, known as instances, in the cloud.
These instances can be used for a variety of purposes, including running applications, hosting websites, and performing data analysis.

Types: 
1.General Purpose: Balanced CPU, memory, and networking (e.g., t3, m5).
2.Compute Optimized: High-performance processors (e.g., c5).
3.Memory Optimized: Large amounts of RAM (e.g., r5).
4.Storage Optimized: High read/write speeds (e.g., i3).
5.Accelerated Computing: GPUs for heavy compute tasks (e.g., p3).


Security Groups:
Virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to instances.

Elastic IP Addresses:
Static, public IP addresses that can be remapped between instances.

Key Pairs:
Secure login credentials (public/private key pairs) for EC2 instances.


EC2 Launch Template:
A launch template simplifies the process of launching instances by allowing you to pre-configure instance settings, 
including the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), instance type, key pair, security groups, and other parameters.

Key Components of a Launch Template
Template Name and Description: A unique name and optional description for identifying the template.
Source Template: Optionally, you can base your new template on an existing one.
AMI ID: Specifies the image to use for launching the instance.
Instance Type: Defines the hardware configuration of the instance.
Key Pair: The SSH key pair used to connect to the instance.
Security Groups: Defines the firewall rules for the instance.
Instance Configuration: Additional settings like network interfaces, IAM roles, user data scripts, and storage volumes.
